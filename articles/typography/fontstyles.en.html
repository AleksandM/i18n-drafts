<p>Many scripts use different types, or styles, of font to render text. A style is typically common to a number of individual fonts, and applies  identifiable visual differences that can be contrasted with other styles.</p>
<p>The different styles are not just cosmetic; they often involve one of the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>distinguishing some content from other content (eg. to distinguish headings from body text),</li>

<li>representing a regional or audience identity (eg. for the Arabic script, the preference for  Nastaliq fonts in Urdu and Kashmiri, or Kano style fonts in Nigeria, rather than the more common Naskh style fonts),</li>

<li>incorporating a  set of characters that differs from font style to font style (eg. Syriac script font styles cover different character repertoires for Western, Eastern, and Estrangela styles),</li>

<li>relating to different behavioural features (such as the differences in justification behaviour for Naskh, Ruq’ah, and Nastaliq fonts).</li>
</ul>

<p>This article provides a non-exhaustive list of examples where choice of a font style may have a practical application related to the above list. The existence of these distinct styles, with their practical influence on the reading of the text, has implications for  fonts on the Web – you would typically  want to choose a fallback font that has the same style, if one is available. We'll look at some implications for generic fonts and fallback mechanisms near the end.</p>





<section id="sec_adlam">
<h2>Adlam</h2>

<p>The Adlam script is used to write Fulani and other African languages. The Fulani are a large, historically nomadic tribe of Africa numbering more than 45 million and spread across Senegambia (Senegal) to the banks of the Nile and the Red Sea.</p>

<p>Adlam  usually uses a <mark>cursive style</mark>, ie. letters in a word are joined up, however a <mark>non-cursive font style</mark> is sometimes used for book, article, and section titles, as well as educational content (because the unconnected script is easier to learn).</p>

<p>Fallback from a non-cursive font to a cursive font would reduce the distinctiveness of titles, but would also have an impact on readability for educational materials.</p>

<section id="sec_arabic">
<h2>Arabic</h2>

<p>The Arabic script is the second most widely-used script in the world, after the Latin alphabet. It is used for various different languages which include sounds that are not used in the Arabic language, and therefore fonts for those languages need to cover different repertoires of characters.</p>

<p>Arabic orthographies can also be grouped into a number of font styles, some of which are more common for particular languages, while others can be used interchangeably for the same language. Sometimes the variations are adapted to usage, for example book text vs. inscriptions; sometimes the variants reflect regional, cultural or stylistic calligraphic preferences.</p>

<p>For a brief introduction to font styles, with examples, see <a href="https://w3c.github.io/alreq/#h_writing_styles">Text Layout Requirements for the Arabic Script</a>. Not all writing styles are described here.</p>

<p>The <mark>Naskh font style</mark> is the most prominent style for the Arabic language, and has become the default form of Arabic language content in most contexts.</p>

<figure id="fig_style_naskh">
<img src="fontstyles-data/style_naskh.png" alt="يحق لكل فرد أن يغادر أية بلاد بما في ذلك بلده كما يحق له العودة إليه." data-source="https://r12a.github.io/scripts/arabic/arb.html#sec_naskh_style">
<figcaption>Arabic is commonly written in the naskh writing style.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The <mark>Nasta’liq font style</mark> is the standard way of writing Urdu and Kashmiri languages. It is also often a preferred style for Persian text. Key features include a sloping baseline for joined letters, and overall complex shaping and positioning for base letters and diacritics alike. There are also distinctive shapes for many glyphs and ligatures.</p>

<p>Additionally, nasta’liq styles require different algorithms for such things as justification and line-breaking, compared to standard naskh styles.</p>

<figure id="fig_style_nastaliq">
<img src="fontstyles-data/style_nastaliq.png" alt="يحق لكل فرد أن يغادر أية بلاد بما في ذلك بلده كما يحق له العودة إليه." data-source="https://r12a.github.io/scripts/arabic/arb.html#sec_nastaliq_style">
<figcaption>The same Arabic language text rendered with the Awami Nastaliq font.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>See more information about the nasta’liq style, as used for <a href="https://r12a.github.io/scripts/arabic/ur#writing_styles">Urdu</a>.</p>

<p>Falling back to an arbitrary font (usually naskh) rather than using a nasta’liq font significantly affects the identity and the readability of the content for speakers of Urdu and Kashmiri.</p>

<p>The<mark> Ruq’ah font style</mark> is commonly used in education, in official documents, and for every-day writing. It is known for its clipped letters composed of short, straight lines and simple curves, as well as its straight and even lines of text. It is a functional style of writing that is quick to write and easy to read. It also doesn’t extend baselines during justification or emphasis, like a naskh font does. In 2010's rebranding of Amman, Jordan, a ruq'ah font family was created to serve as an italic face alongside a naskh regular font. Monotype has an interesting <a href="https://www.monotype.com/resources/articles/ruqah-the-new-style">article</a> on the development of ruq'ah.</p>

<p>Falling back to a non-ruq’ah font removes the effect of handwritten text and may remove the distinction between italic vs. regular styles in signage and other content using the FF Amman font in Jordan.</p>

<figure id="fig_style_ruqah">
<img src="fontstyles-data/style_ruqah.png" alt="يحق لكل فرد أن يغادر أية بلاد بما في ذلك بلده كما يحق له العودة إليه." data-source="https://r12a.github.io/scripts/arabic/arb.html#sec_ruqah_style">

</figure>

<p>The <mark>Kano font style</mark> is a common way of writing Hausa, especially in Northern Nigeria, in the ajami script, and like other West African writing it is based on Warsh (Warš) forms, which incorporate Maghribi characteristics. Text written in the Kano style will include glyphs for a number of African characters that may not be available in the average naskh font.</p>

<p>Falling back to an arbitrary font will remove the identity of the content, and is likely to cause rendering failures for African characters. In fact, there is another orthography that looks much closer to naskh that is used with hand-written adaptations for the newspaper Al-Fijir, based on the Hafs orthography, but when writing in that orthography you need to use different code points from those used for the Kano style. So falling back to this would presumably lead to some confusion.</p>

<p>The <mark>Kufi font style</mark> is the original style used for the Koran, but is not used for newspapers or official content today. However, it is used in modern content for logos and other stylised applications.</p>

<p>Falling back to an arbitrary font would lose the decorative distinctions provided by the kufi font. This is, however, not quite the same as failing to render a Latin decorative font, since for Arabic this is a writing style, and there are likely to be other kufi style fonts on the system that would retain the decorative distinction intended.</p>

<section id="sec_chinese">
<h2>Chinese</h2>

<p>In Chinese different writing styles tend to be applied to different bits of content in the same document to distinguish one feature of the content from another. Remember also that bolding, italicisation and underlining are not native traditions for Chinese, and so font choice is often used to distinguish one type of text from another. This is actually a common technique in a number of scripts, not just Chinese.</p>

<p>The <mark>Song font style</mark> is the most common typeface used in Chinese printing. Song is commonly used in text, headings and annotations. When used in headings, the characters will appear in a bold face, so as to distinguish the heading from the text.</p>

<figure id="fig_zh_song">

<figcaption>The Song font style.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The <mark>Kai font style</mark> provides calligraphic styles for Chinese characters. It shows notable handwriting features. Kai is mainly used in text that needs to be differentiated from the rest of the content, for example, headlines, references, quotations, and dialogs. (It is rarely used for emphasis, because of its similarity to Song.)</p>

<figure id="fig_zh_kai">

<figcaption>The kai font style.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The <mark>Hei font style</mark>, also known as Gothic, is a type style characterized by strokes of even thickness, reduced curves, and a lack of decoration. It is commonly used in headlines, signs, and personal names in dialogs. In body text, characters in Hei style with thicker strokes typically indicate emphasis. Traditionally, publications rarely apply the Hei style for content, but with the growing influence of the World Wide Web and the digital publishing industry, some publications are starting to experiment with Hei in this context.</p>

<figure id="fig_zh_hei">

<figcaption>The hei font style.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The <mark>Fangsong font style</mark> lies between Song and Kai. It is commonly used in secondary titles and isolated paragraphs such as quotations or highlighted sentences.</p>

<figure id="fig_zh_fangsong">
<img src="fontstyles-data/zh_fangsong.png" alt="" class="ex" lang="zh-hans" data-source="https://w3c.github.io/clreq/#four_commonly_used_typefaces_for_chinese_composition">
<figcaption>The fangsong font style.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Fallback to a single, arbitrary font is problematic because nullifies the distinctive characteristics of the text to which one of the above writing styles has been applied, for example removing emphasis.</p>

<section id="sec_khmer">
<h2>Khmer</h2>

<p>Khmer is the script for the Cambodian language, which has around 16,000,000 speakers, and for several minority languages.</p>

<p>The <mark>upright font style</mark>  (called <span lang="km">អក្សរឈរ</span> <span class="transcription">âksâr chôr</span>) is used for most modern typefaces.</p>

<figure id="fig_km_upright">
<img src="fontstyles-data/km_upright.png" alt="មនុស្សទាំងអស់ កើតមកមានសេរីភាព និងសមភាព" class="ex" lang="km" data-source="UDHR" data-notes="Khmer Mondulkiri 32px">
<figcaption>The Khmer upright font style.</figcaption>
</figure>


<p>A slanted font style <span lang="km">(អក្សរជ្រៀង</span> <span class="transcription">âksâr chriĕng</span>) may be also be used for whole documents or novels. The oblique styling has no effect on the semantics of the text.</p>

<figure id="fig_km_slanted">
<img src="fontstyles-data/km_slanted.png" alt="មនុស្សទាំងអស់ កើតមកមានសេរីភាព និងសមភាព" class="ex" lang="km" data-source="UDHR" data-notes="Metal 32px">
<figcaption>A Khmer slanted font style.</figcaption>
</figure>


<p>The <mark>round font style</mark> (<span lang="km">អក្សរមូល</span> <span class="transcription">âksâr mul</span>) has more rounded letter shapes and includes more ligated forms. It is commonly used for titles and headings in Cambodian documents, books, or currency, as well as on shop signs or banners. It may also be used to emphasise important names or nouns. The regular weight of these fonts tend to look like bold text.</p>

<figure id="fig_km_round">
