  <p>A <dfn id="def_floating_time">floating time</dfn> or a <dfn id="dfn_floating_date">floating date</dfn> is a time value that isn't tied to a specific time zone. 
     Applications that work with floating times need to avoid pitfalls that can arise from implicit conversion to <em>incremental time</em> values or the improper
     use of time zones when displaying or processing a floating time value.
  </p>

  <h2 id="detail"><a href="#detail">Details</a></h2>
  <p>The <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.w3.org/TR/timezone/">Working with Timezones</a> WG Note says:</p>
  
<blockquote> <p>Some observed time values are not related to a specific 
moment in incremental time. Instead, they need to be combined with 
local information to determine a range of acceptable incremental time 
values. We refer to these sorts of time values as "floating times" 
because they are not fixed to a specific incremental time value. 
Floating times are not attached and should never be attached to a 
particular time zone.</p> </blockquote> 

<p>That is, a floating time value is a time value that is associated with many 
different discrete instants in time and that all share some specific relationship. 
Common examples of floating times include concepts such as birth date, 
starting or ending dates for a worldwide event, holidays, or 
publication dates.</p>

<h3>An Example: Martina's Newspaper</h3>
   
<p>As an example, let's consider the publication date of an online newspaper. On <em>30 April 2017</em> 
this newspaper published an online Sunday edition.</p>

<p>Martina is a subscriber who lives in Buenos Aires, Argentina. When she visits the newspaper's web site, she is given the option of 
selecting which edition she wants to view. The HTML for the form control might look like this:</p>

<figure class="example">
	<pre>&lt;label for="publicationDate"&gt;Which issue would you like:&lt;/label&gt;
&lt;input id="publicationDateInput" type="datetime-local"&gt;</pre>
</figure>

<p>When Martina fills in the form and submits it, though, she is surprised to see that the edition she receives is  dated <em>Saturday, 29 April 2017</em> instead. The actual newspaper is the correct Sunday edition. But the screen says the wrong date. What's going on?</p>

<p>Problems such as this can arise if Web developers or content authors 
do not treat the publication date as a floating time value. For 
example, the JavaScript <code class="kw" translate="no">Date</code> 
object is a form of <em>incremental</em> time: it represents the number 
of milliseconds since an <span class="qterm">epoch date</span>. In the 
case of JavaScript, the epoch data is the same as that used by Unix, 
the Java programming language, and many other systems: it's defined as 
midnight, January 1, 1970 in the UTC (Universal Coordinated Time) time 
zone. So for Martina's newspaper, the value in the HTML form she 
submitted might be converted in JavaScript to a <code class="kw" 
translate="no">Date</code> object with the value: 
<kbd>1493510400000</kbd> (in milliseconds since the epoch). That long
integer value actually represents the instant of midnight, 30 April, 
2017 in Coordinated Universal Time (UTC). At that moment, it was still
only 9:00 PM (21:00) in Buenos Aires on the previous day, 
Saturday, 29 April, 2017.</p>
  
    <figure class="example">
    <pre>var date = new Date(publicationDateInput.value);
var target = document.getElementById(&quot;date-target&quot;);
target.appendChild(document.createTextNode(date.toDateString()));</pre>
  </figure>
  
  <p>Suppose your element <code class="kw" translate="no">publicationDateInput</code> contained the value used in the example above ("2017-04-30"). You'd expect the element whose ID is <code class="kw" translate="no">date-target</code> to contain a string representing that date. However, if you live in a time zone west of UTC (such as Martina does, in the <code class="kw" translate="no">America/Buenos_Aires</code> time zone), you'll get a surprise. It says something like: </p>
  <figure class="example">
    <pre>Sat Apr 29 2017</pre>
  </figure>
  <p>The problem here is that many of the <code class="kw" translate="no">Date</code> methods in JavaScript are sensitive to the local system's time zone and they try to present the date's incremental time value using local time zone rules. Because the time of day was not specified in the string "2017-04-30", the time is treated as <q>midnight</q>, so anyone displaying the underlying value in a time zone following UTC will naturally see the previous day. In the case of a system running in the <code class="kw" translate="no">America/Buenos_Aires</code> time zone, which has an offset from UTC of either -3 hours or -2 hours (depending on whether or not daylight savings time is in effect) the value presented to the user from the JavaScript is incorrect because the the <code class="kw" translate="no">time</code> portion of the publication date is zeroed out. Subtracting two or three hours from the <code class="kw" translate="no">Date</code> object results in a presentation string that is on the <span class="qterm">previous</span> day. That day might be in the wrong month or even the wrong year.</p>
  
  <p>Here's a more complete example showing the interaction between floating and incremental time values:</p>
  
  <figure class="example">
  <pre><code>
  var mypanel = document.createElement('div');
  
  var date = new Date("2017-04-30");
  var content = document.createElement('p');
  // this produces "Sat Apr 29 2017"
  content.appendChild(document.createTextNode(date.toDateString()));
  mypanel.appendChild(content);
  
  // the Intl extension provides locale-awareness and
  // supports different time zones, at least in some browsers.
  // this code formats the same Date value using the Buenos Aires
  // time zone and a Spanish/Argentina locale
  content = document.createElement('p');
  var options = {
    month: 'long',
    day: 'numeric',
    year: 'numeric',
    hour: 'numeric',
    minute: 'numeric',
    timeZoneName: 'short',
    timeZone: 'America/Buenos_Aires'
  };
  content.appendChild(document.createTextNode(
      new Intl.DateTimeFormat('es-AR', options).format(date)));
  mypanel.appendChild(content);
  
  // the above shows: "29 de abril de 2017 21:00 ART"
  
  content = document.createElement('p');
  options = {
    month: 'long',
    day: 'numeric',
    year: 'numeric',
    hour: 'numeric',
    minute: 'numeric',
    timeZoneName: 'short',
    timeZone: 'UTC'
  };
  content.appendChild(document.createTextNode(
      new Intl.DateTimeFormat('es-AR', options).format(date)));
      
  // Using UTC finally results in displaying the expected value:
  // "30 de abril de 2017 00:00 GMT"
      
  mypanel.appendChild(content);
  
  document.body.appendChild(mypanel);
  </code></pre></figure>
  
  <p>Because the local interpretation of a given date depends on the local time&mdash;that is, it depends 
  on the local calendar, clock, and time zone rules&mdash;the range of incremental times that might be described as <samp>2017-04-30</samp> turns out to span as many as fifty hours. The earliest time that can be called "30 April 2017" starts in Kiribati in the South Pacific, some 14 hours before midnight on 30 April 2017 occurs in UTC. The last moment that can be called part of "30 April 2017" occurs just before midnight of "1 May 2017" on the island of Midway's time zone, some 11 hours after "30 April 2017" has ended in UTC (there is an even later zone, but it is uninhabited). Depending on the time zone used to create and then later to display an incremental time value, the same floating date value could appear to be as much as two days off.</p>
  
  <p>That's because, while a floating time is not tied to a specific time zone, any incremental time values depend 
  on time zone for their display and processing. Since data formats for time values in both server-side (such as Java or PHP) 
  and client-side languages (such as JavaScript) are usually incremental times, this can lead to problems such as Martina's mysterious
  newspaper publication date. </p>
  
  <p>There are several ways to work around this. One method is to always use the UTC time zone for processing floating time values. Developers have to be careful to convert time values into incremental time objects using an offset of zero and segregate code that deals with floating times from more-normal time values such as time stamps.</p>
  
  <p>In other cases, there are data types or APIs that can help by keeping floating times "floating". For example, if you're a Java developer writing server code, you can (carefully) use data types from Joda time (part of the JDK since 1.8), such as <code>LocalDate</code> to create and process time values without imposing a specific time zone. A Java <code>LocalDate</code> is an example of a floating time value.</p>
  
  <p>In client-side scripting with JavaScript, this means that if you pass a floating time to the single-argument string constructor for Date, which treats its argument as UTC, then you cannot use time-zone-aware methods such as toDateString and toString. If you are writing a web application, and are performing further date calculations that involve the current time for the user, consider using the user's local time zone instead: if you are using the Date object, construct it by passing in separate integer year, month and day values. You are then free to perform any calculations and finally use toDateString to format the date for display if required.</p>
  
  <h3 id="yyyshortcomings2"><a href="#yyyshortcomings">Storing, Retrieving, and Aggregating Time Data</a></h3>
  <p>Another way that floating times are used is in the aggregation of data. For example, suppose you are
  building an application that keeps track of the number of downloads a user makes. You can record each
  download using a timestamp (an incremental time value). That might look like this: </p>
  <figure class="example">
    <pre>{
    &quot;user-id&quot;: &quot;9333c644-487a-11e7-a919-92ebcb67fe33&quot;,
    &quot;item&quot;: &quot;http://www.example.com/downloadMe&quot;,
    &quot;date&quot;: &quot;2013-10-02T07:17:00Z&quot;,
    &quot;user-timezone&quot;: &quot;America/Los_Angeles&quot;
},</pre>
  </figure>
  <p>When your application wants to aggregate statistics, the use of incremental times
    to represent the aggregated data could become a problem. Suppose you want to 
    accumulate user statistics, such as total downloads, on a daily basis. 
    The timestamp in the example above might fall on October 2, 2013 for that customer. 
    In this case, if the time zone were <code class=kw translate=no>America/Los_Angeles</code> as
    shown in the record, it would not! Here's what the accumulated record might look like:</p>
  <figure class="example">
    <pre>{
    &quot;user-id&quot;: &quot;9333c644-487a-11e7-a919-92ebcb67fe33&quot;,
    &quot;aggregationDate&quot;: &quot;2013-10-01&quot;,
    &quot;numDownloaded&quot;: 10
},</pre>
  </figure>
  <p>In this case, you want to use local time rules, including the time zone,
  in order to compute which floating date the download should accumulate to. But you want to use floating time
  rules to read and write the accumulated data record. That way the statistics remain the same
  for a given date, even if the user's time zone has changed in the interim. For example,
  if the customer moves to the <code class=kw translate=no>Europe/Paris</code> time zone, the
  number of downloads on <code>2013-10-01</code> should remain the same, even though the
  accumulation rules might be different now than they were previously.</p>
